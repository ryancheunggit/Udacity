def compute_r_squared(data, predictions):
    '''
    In exercise 5, we calculated the R^2 value for you. But why don't you try and
    and calculate the R^2 value yourself.

    Given a list of original data points, and also a list of predicted data points,
    write a function that will compute and return the coefficient of determination (R^2)
    for this data.  numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() might both be useful here, but
    not necessary.

    Documentation about numpy.mean() and numpy.sum() below:

    '''

    r_squared = 1-np.sum((data-predictions)**2)/np.sum((data-np.mean(data))**2)


    return r_squared
