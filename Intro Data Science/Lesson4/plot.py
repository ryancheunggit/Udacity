def lineplot(hr_year_csv):
    # A csv file will be passed in as an argument which
    # contains two columns -- 'HR' (the number of homerun hits)
    # and 'yearID' (the year in which the homeruns were hit).
    #
    # Fill out the body of this function, lineplot, to use the
    # passed-in csv file, hr_year.csv, and create a
    # chart with points connected by lines, both colored 'red',
    # showing the number of HR by year.
    #
    # You will want to first load the csv file into a pandas dataframe
    # and use the pandas dataframe along with ggplot to create your visualization
    #
    # You can check out the data in the csv file at the link below:
